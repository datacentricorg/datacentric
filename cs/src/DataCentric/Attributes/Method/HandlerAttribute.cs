    ///
    /// A handler method must return void and either take no
    /// parameters, or take parameters that are a combination
    /// of:
    ///
    /// * Atomic types
    /// * Classes derived from Data
    ///
    /// While passing Record types as handler parameters is not
    /// prohibited, best practice is to pass such parameters by
    /// specifying their key rather than their data.
